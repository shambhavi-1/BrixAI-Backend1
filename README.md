BrixAI is an AI-powered construction assistant built entirely on Zoho Cliq. It turns messy site communication (voice notes, photos, and chats) into structured tasks, issues, and daily reports, without forcing workers to learn a new app.​

On the ground, supervisors and laborers only see two or three big buttons like “Speak progress”, “Upload photo”, or “Request tools”. Managers, engineers, vendors, and safety officers see dashboards, summaries, and alerts inside Cliq widgets and bot messages. The experience feels like four or five different apps, but everything runs from a single Cliq integration with role-based menus, widgets, forms, and bot behavior.​

BrixAI automatically:

Converts voice updates into day logs and tasks using speech-to-text.

Summarizes daily activity into short, actionable briefs for managers.

Flags potential delays and material shortages using simple AI rules plus LLM reasoning.

Helps report issues with photos, classifies severity, and assigns them to the right person.

Keeps all actions traceable inside Cliq channels so teams don’t lose context.

From a technical side, BrixAI uses:

Zoho Cliq bots, widgets, commands, message actions, and extension handlers for the full in-chat experience.

A backend that connects to AI services (LLM, speech, vision) to process messages, images, and logs.

Role-based rendering so each user’s UI, menus, and cards are generated dynamically from the same backend and extension.​

The goal is to show how a familiar chat tool can become a full construction control center: reducing delays, improving safety, and letting even non-technical workers contribute with just their voice and camera.
